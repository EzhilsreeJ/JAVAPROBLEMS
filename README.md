# 🚀 Java Training Documentation

📅 **Duration:** April 2025 – May 2025  
🏁 **Practice Platform:** LeetCode  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentor:** Mr. Sukumar 🙏

## 📖 About

This repository is a complete log of my **Java training journey**. It includes:

✅ Working Java solutions to algorithmic and data structure problems  
💡 Notes and learnings from daily problem-solving  
🧠 Hands-on coding practice with Java features like recursion, bitwise operations, and OOP  
🎯 Practice focused on **logic building**, **pattern solving**, and **real-world problem understanding**

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

Here are the main areas I’ve explored:

- Arrays & Strings
- Recursion
- Bit Manipulation
- Matrix Problems
- Sorting & Searching
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Multi-threading (Basics)
- Pattern Printing
- Exception Handling
- Miscellaneous Logic Building

---

## 📂 Folder Overview

My Java source files are grouped by topic for easy navigation:

```
JAVAPROBLEMS/
├── bitwise/          → Bit manipulation & XOR-based problems
├── recursion/        → Recursive programs (factorial, Fibonacci, etc.)
├── strings/          → String operations (prefix, reverse, etc.)
├── matrix/           → 2D array & matrix logic
├── oop/              → OOP concepts using classes and objects
├── others/           → Pattern printing, conversions, and misc logic
```

> Note: File names describe the problem (e.g. `armstrong.java`, `Add_two_sorted_array.java`, `SumOfArrayUsingRecursion.java`).

## 🚀 How to Run

You can compile and run these programs directly from the terminal.

### Step-by-step:

1. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd JAVAPROBLEMS
   ```

2. Compile the file you want:

   ```bash
   javac src/recursion/SumOfArrayUsingRecursion.java
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java src.recursion.SumOfArrayUsingRecursion
   ```

> Make sure the class name and file name match exactly, and Java is installed properly.

## ✅ TODO (My Goals)

- [ ] Solve 100+ problems from LeetCode
- [ ] Practice multi-threading examples
- [ ] Explore collections (List, Map, Set)
- [ ] Start writing test cases (JUnit)
- [ ] Upload simple GUI apps using Java Swing

## 🙌 Special Thanks

A big thank you to **Mr. Sukumar** for guiding me through this learning phase. His mentorship and support made a huge impact on how I understand programming today.

## ✨ Final Note

This repository is for my **reference and revision**. I’m documenting this journey so I can look back and also use it as a starting point for future Java projects.

**Let’s keep coding and growing! 💻🔥**
