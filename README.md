#  Java Training Repository

A comprehensive collection of Java practice programs developed during my focused training from **April 2025 to May 2025**, under the mentorship of **Mr. Sukumar**.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository documents my hands-on journey into Java, solving algorithmic and data structure problems while building strong fundamentals in:

- Core Java Syntax
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Recursion & Bitwise Operations
- String and Matrix Manipulation
- Problem-solving with LeetCode challenges

Each Java file is organized by topic and represents a complete, working solution with clean logic and structure.

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Bit Manipulation  
- Matrix Problems  
- Sorting & Searching Algorithms  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Basic Multi-threading Concepts  
- Pattern Printing  
- Exception Handling & Edge Case Management

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure Java is installed (`java -version`) and follow the steps below:

1. **Navigate to the folder**:
   ```bash
   cd JAVAPROBLEMS
   ```

2. **Compile the Java file**:
   ```bash
   javac src/recursion/SumOfArrayUsingRecursion.java
   ```

3. **Run the compiled class**:
   ```bash
   java src.recursion.SumOfArrayUsingRecursion
   ```

> ⚠️ Ensure the file name and class name match exactly. Java is case-sensitive.
