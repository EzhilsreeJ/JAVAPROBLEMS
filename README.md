## 📘 Overview

Welcome to my **Java practice archive**! This repository reflects my journey of mastering Java through structured problem-solving and hands-on coding. During this focused training, I built a solid foundation in:

- ✅ Core Java Syntax & Programming Fundamentals  
- 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- 🔁 Recursion & Bitwise Operations  
- 🧵 String and Matrix Manipulation  
- 🧩 Algorithm Challenges from LeetCode & more

Every Java file in this repository is **well-commented**, **functionally correct**, and designed to reinforce **logical thinking and coding fluency**.

## 🛠️ How to Run

Ensure Java is installed by running:
```bash
java -version
```

Then, follow these steps to run any program:

1. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```bash
   cd JAVAPROBLEMS
   ```

2. **Compile the Java file**:
   ```bash
   javac src/recursion/SumOfArrayUsingRecursion.java
   ```

3. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   java src.recursion.SumOfArrayUsingRecursion
   ```

> ⚠️ **Note:** File names and class names must match exactly. Java is case-sensitive.
